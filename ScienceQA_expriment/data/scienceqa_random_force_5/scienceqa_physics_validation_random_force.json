The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms.

Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.", "solution": "Look at the distance each fish moved and the time it took to move that distance.\nOne fish moved 20 kilometers in 5 hours.\nThe other fish moved 25 kilometers in 5 hours.\nNotice that each fish spent the same amount of time moving. The fish that moved 20 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time.
