So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.\nThe amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.\nWhen an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...\nincreases | increases\ndecreases | decreases\nstays the same | stays the same", "solution": "Think about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.\nJeremiah was lower than the balcony.
