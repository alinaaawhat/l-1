A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.", "solution": "Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethanol contains four symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, F for fluorine, and O for oxygen. So, fluoromethanol is made of four chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethanol is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for helium contains one symbol: He. So, helium is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, helium is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for boron trifluoride contains two symbols: B for boron and F for fluorine. So, boron trifluoride is made of two chemical elements bonded together.

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2.

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms.

Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter.

This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms.
