When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!", "solution": "", "input": "", "instruction": "Context: Brooke visits a museum about ancient Greece.

It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.\nA poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.\nEnd rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.\nLittle Betty Blue,\nLost her holiday shoe.\n\u2014From Mother Goose\nInternal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.\nSweet dreams of pleasant streams.\n\u2014From William Blake, \"A Cradle Song\"\nRhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n\u2014From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \"The Eagle\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n\u2014From Hilda Conkling, \"The Old Bridge\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n\u2014Adapted from Mary E. Burt, \"The Flying Squirrel\"\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n\u2014From Bayard Taylor, \"A Night with a Wolf\"\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.\n\u2014From Alfred Noyes, \"The Highwayman\"\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:\nHark! the honey bee is humming.\n\u2014From Mary Howitt, \"The Voice of Spring\"", "solution": "This poem has a regular rhythm, or a pattern of sound like a beat.

Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n\u2014From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \"The Eagle\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n\u2014From Hilda Conkling, \"The Old Bridge\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n\u2014Adapted from Mary E. Burt, \"The Flying Squirrel\"\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n\u2014From Bayard Taylor, \"A Night with a Wolf\"\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.\n\u2014From Alfred Noyes, \"The Highwayman\"\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:\nHark! the honey bee is humming.\n\u2014From Mary Howitt, \"The Voice of Spring\"", "solution": "This poem uses end rhyme.

Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n\u2014From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \"The Eagle\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n\u2014From Hilda Conkling, \"The Old Bridge\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong.

It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n\u2014Adapted from Mary E. Burt, \"The Flying Squirrel\"\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n\u2014From Bayard Taylor, \"A Night with a Wolf\"\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.\n\u2014From Alfred Noyes, \"The Highwayman\"\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:\nHark! the honey bee is humming.\n\u2014From Mary Howitt, \"The Voice of Spring\"", "solution": "This poem uses repetition.

You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n\u2014From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \"The Eagle\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n\u2014From Hilda Conkling, \"The Old Bridge\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n\u2014Adapted from Mary E.

Had they heard it?
